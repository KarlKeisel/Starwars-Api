Starwars API:

This app will use React to pull from and display the data from the API received from the Starwars API: "https://swapi.co/api/"

I made this to help gain more practice with API calls, and sorting and writing my components in React.

I plan to make two exact copies of this project, one with Class-Based components and the other with Hook Functions. I am doing two because Hooks look amazing and I want to continue with those, but since the vast majority of React is still in Class-Based Components, I am writing in the same way to help me work with legacy code.

This one is the Class-Based one.
